REFACTORING
===========

* State::Base#collided_with? should be a GameObject instance method
* remove references to $window
* State::Base instances should have a resources instance attr, instead of
  getting them from $window
* Extract background drawing into a separate module
* is finite_state_machine needed?
* GameObject#{centre,two_corners,four_corners} should return Points.
* remove boosting from Player
* don't use eval in LevelParser
