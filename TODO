REFACTORING
===========

* State::Base#collided_with? should be a GameObject instance method
* remove references to $window
* State::Base instances should have a resources instance attr, instead of
  getting them from $window
* is finite_state_machine needed?
* don't use eval in LevelParser
* extract crosshair cursor into separate module
* Mouse location function, returning a Point
